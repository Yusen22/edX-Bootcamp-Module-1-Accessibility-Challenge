# edX-Bootcamp-Module-1-Accessibility-Challenge


## Description

This project involves refactoring starter HTML and CSS code provided by a bootcamp to improve accessibility for users and search engine optimisation on a simple webpage. This is achieved by the use of alternate text tags on images, the employment of semantic HTML elements, and the organisation of HTML and CSS code into a logical flow. Furthermore, selectors within CSS are consolidated to avoid unecessary complexity and encourage best practice with regard to collaboration, as well as a number of comments on the 
'style.css'. 

In completing this project, an emphasis was placed on maintaining the design and functionality of the webpage provided whilst implementing the aforementioned accessibility features. This gave practice in completing an on-the-job ticket - in this case for fictional marketing agency, 'Horiseon' - whereby given code is to be improved upon with it's functionality remaining the same. Furthermore, completing the project to this brief provided practice in finding alternative approaches to achieve the same solutions. This was exemplified in the project in the header image, where it was initially displayed through 'style.css', but was changed to be displayed through 'index.html' for accessibility improvement.
